{"name":"Tmr","tagline":"","body":"# Tmr - Simple job tracking timer to run from your terminal. \r\n\r\nTmr uses Python and an SQlite database to store your timed events. Tmr's only dependency outside of Python's stdlib is [Peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee), an easy to use ORM. Written with Python 3.4 in mind, but it *should* work in most version 2.7+.\r\n\r\n## To install:\r\n\r\nDownload the source, cd into the source folder, and run `pip install .`. Eventually I hope to get it up on PyPI.\r\n\r\n## Example usage after installation:\r\n\r\n###### `tmr init`\r\n\r\nThis will initialize your database. It only needs to be run once after installation.\r\n\r\n###### `tmr start TITLE`\r\n\r\nThis will start a timer with the title TITLE.\r\n\r\n###### `tmr end TITLE`\r\n\r\nThis will end a timer with the title TITLE.\r\n\r\n###### `tmr list`\r\n\r\nThis will list all running timers.\r\n\r\n###### `tmr export`\r\n\r\nThis will export the timers to a csv file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
