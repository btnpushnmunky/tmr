Intro

Tmr is used to keep track of timed events. In contrast to complicated web interfaces and fancy GUI's, tmr is used from the terminal or command line.

Often times, I've found that I want to use something extremely simple to keep track of time spent on projects. This is extremely simple. The only thing it assumes is a functioning Python installation. Mac OS X and Linux users will have a system installation, but Windows users will need to download the correct installer from the Python `website <http://www.python.org>`_.
