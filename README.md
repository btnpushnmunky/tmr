# Tmr - Simple job tracking timer to run from your terminal.

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tmr/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tmr/?badge=latest)

Tmr uses Python and an SQlite database to store your timed events. Tmr's only dependency outside of Python's stdlib is [Peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee), an easy to use ORM. Written with Python 3.4 in mind, but it *should* work in most version 2.7+.
